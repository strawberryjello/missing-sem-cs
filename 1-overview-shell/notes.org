*** Steps 1-7: Creating an executable script

Using =touch= and =echo= to create the script file:

#+begin_src sh
touch semester
echo '#!/bin/sh' > semester
echo "curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu" >> semester
#+end_src

Notes
- =>>= appends to the file instead of overwriting its contents

Using =chmod= to change the file permissions:

#+begin_src sh
chmod +x semester
#+end_src

*** Step 8: Extracting last-modified date from HTTP response header

Call the script, then use =grep= and =cut= to extract the date, then write output to a file

#+begin_src sh
./semester | grep -i "last-modified" | cut --delimiter=':' -f2 > last-modified.txt
#+end_src

Notes
- Originally tried this with =grep -irn=, which didn't work; =-r= (recursive search) and =-n= (display line numbers) don't apply in this case
- I tend to use =grep -irn= out of habit, didn't immediately notice that this was causing issues
