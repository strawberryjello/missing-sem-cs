*** Steps 1-7: Creating an executable script

Using =touch= and =echo= to create the script file:

#+begin_src sh
touch semester
echo '#!/bin/sh' > semester
echo "curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu" >> semester
#+end_src

Notes
- =>>= appends to the file instead of overwriting its contents

Using =chmod= to change the file permissions:

#+begin_src sh
chmod +x semester
#+end_src

*** Step 8: Extracting last-modified date from HTTP response header

Call the script, then use =grep= and =cut= to extract the date, then write output to a file

#+begin_src sh
./semester | grep -i "last-modified" | cut --delimiter=':' -f2 > last-modified.txt
#+end_src

Notes
- Originally tried this with =grep -irn=, which didn't work; =-r= (recursive search) and =-n= (display line numbers) don't apply in this case
  - I tend to use =grep -irn= out of habit, didn't immediately notice that this was causing issues
- =--delimiter= only accepts a single character

*** Step 9: Battery power level or CPU temperature from /sys

I wasn't able to find the correct files containing this information under =/sys= (I'm currently on openSUSE Leap 15.1), so I looked this up

**** Battery power

- I found an [[https://askubuntu.com/questions/69556/how-do-i-check-the-batterys-status-via-the-terminal][Ubuntu-related question on Ask Ubuntu]] with an answer that suggests using =upower= to display battery information

- Check list of devices with =upower -e= (=-e= is short for =--enumerate=) to get the battery path, then use =upower -i= (=-i= is short for =--show-info=) with the path to display the battery information, for example:

#+begin_src sh
upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0
#+end_src

  - This will display a long list of information; the battery power level is in the line that contains =state:=, so far the values I've found for this field are =fully-charged= and =discharging=

**** CPU temperature

The ff. article suggests installing =hddtemp= to see hard drive and SSD temperatures and =sensors= to see the CPU temperature, haven't tried these yet
